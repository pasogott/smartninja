Your friend was so happy with your program that he told everyone how great programmer you are. A nearby restaurant owner heard about this and immediately contacted you.

He'd like to have a program where he'd enter their daily menu and it would get saved into a menu.txt file. The menu would consist of a dish (like "Beef steak with potatoes" and a price of the dish (e.g. 5.40).
